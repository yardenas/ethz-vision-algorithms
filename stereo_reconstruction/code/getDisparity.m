function disp_img = getDisparity(...
    left_img, right_img, patch_radius, min_disp, max_disp)
% left_img and right_img are both H x W and you should return a H x W
% matrix containing the disparity d for each pixel of left_img. Set
% disp_img to 0 for pixels where the SSD and/or d is not defined, and for d
% estimates rejected in Part 2. patch_radius specifies the SSD patch and
% each valid d should satisfy min_disp <= d <= max_disp.
