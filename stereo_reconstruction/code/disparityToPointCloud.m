function [points, intensities] = disparityToPointCloud(...
    disp_img, K, baseline, left_img)
% points should be 3xN and intensities 1xN, where N is the amount of pixels
% which have a valid disparity. I.e., only return points and intensities
% for pixels of left_img which have a valid disparity estimate! The i-th
% intensity should correspond to the i-th point.
